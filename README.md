## Game Development Details

This game is a [Game Off 2022](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2022) game jam submission.

The game jam theme is **cliche**. Therefore, you're hacking a ~~Penth~~ Hexagon
using some retro-style hacking device with bright green consoles.

The game created using [Ebitengine](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/).
It's proper home is [quasilyte/ge](https://github.com/quasilyte/ge/) repository,
but since it's a requirement to create a separate per-game repository, here we are.
